# My own REST API and CMS
---
Hyper Island - Data Interaction module - Brief 7


### :scroll: Brief:
Build a REST API with a CMS where the user can add, edit and delete pages and articles and a startpage which displays the information. 


### :hourglass: Time spent:
3 weeks.


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
Have a better understanding of backend vs. frontend and how everything ties together, deeper understanding of API's and basic knowledge in MySQL and PHP.


### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:
I decided to build my API from scratch using PHP for my backend, MySQL for my database and vanilla JavaScript for my frontend. After completing my one ingredient cookbook I went into a Udemy course where we actually made another API but using Node.js, express and MongoDB. This practice really made me understand the bigger concepts and insights in why you would choose one or the other.


### :closed_book: Learnings:

* The difference between NoSQL-databases like MongoDB and SQL-databases like MySQL
* Deeper understanding of how everything comes together, frontend vs. backend
* Deeper understanding of API's, and how properly to use them
